# OCD-Patient-Insights (Interactive Dashboard using SQL & Power BI)

## Summary
This project is about turning raw OCD patient data into clear insights. Using SQL queries and Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that shows how OCD symptoms vary across age groups, genders, education levels, and treatments. 

## Overview 
This project studies data from 1,500 OCD patients using SQL and Power BI. The dataset includes details like age, gender, education, family history, obsession and compulsion types, scores, and medications. SQL queries were used to answer 14 key questions, and the results were shown in Power BI with charts and filters. The dashboard makes it easy to see patterns such as which age group has the highest scores, which compulsions are most common, and how family history or medication affects symptom duration

## Problem Statement
Raw patient data is hard to understand. It doesn’t clearly show which age group has the highest scores, which compulsions are most common, or how family history and medications affect outcomes.
This project uses SQL queries and Power BI visuals to turn the dataset into clear insights, making patterns easy to explore and present.
